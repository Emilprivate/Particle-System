# Particle System
My Particle System is a particle system with a friendly user-interface to control basic physics functions of each individual particle. 

The project was made doing highschool/college or 'Gymnasie' in Danish. This is a school project in the subject 'Programming B' doing second year. 

### References

My Particle System uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) - User-Interface for option-interaction
* [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) - Graphical-User-Interface for the window and particles
